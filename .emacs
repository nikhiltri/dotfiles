;; Version: 1.0.0

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; After numerous interations of configuring emacs with my daily workflow,
;; this is the simplest version I've brought things down to. As I work on
;; new projects, this may get more complicated again. But for now, this
;; does most of what I feel is useful.

;;; TO DO:
;;
;; Perhaps if I'm working with a new programming language that requires
;;   customizations, add them to a separate file that gets imported here.
;;   So I can remove the more experiemental customizations easily.

;;; Code
(custom-set-variables
 ;; custom-set-variables was added by Custom.
 ;; If you edit it by hand, you could mess it up, so be careful.
 ;; Your init file should contain only one such instance.
 ;; If there is more than one, they won't work right.
